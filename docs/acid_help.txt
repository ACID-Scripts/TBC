Acid 0.0.1 Release Help file



ACID is the encapsulation of database information for ScriptDev2. Currently ACID will only contain EventAI scripts but in the future we plan on adding opening events and all text sent to the client into ACID for localization support. to find out more look at http://forums.scriptdev2.com/index.php?showtopic=2057

Acid SVN : https://sd2-acid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sd2-acid/



Acid team : 

X-Savior - Lead Acid Dev

Dpilon - Acid Dev

Seline - Acid/SD2 Dev



Installation Instructions :



Acid releases will mostly consist of two parts xxx_acid_yyy_mangos.sql and xxx_acid_yyy_scriptdev.sql where xxx will be the revision number for Acid and yyy will be the revision number for SD2 at time of the Acid release. To install Acid you MUST have a *working* installation of mangos and your favorite DB project. get the latest copy of the acid sql files from full_release/x.x.x/ folder of the svn where the x.x.x represent the revision number, so for revision 0.0.1 you would look in https://sd2-acid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sd2-acid/full_release/0.0.1/. 



* Make sure your copy of mangos has the base mangos SQL and a full DB inserted and working.



AFTER applying your Mangos and SD2 Updates apply the following ACID Packs



* Insert xxx_acid_yyy_mangos.sql into your Mangos Database (Named mangos by default)

* Insert xxx_acid_yyy_scriptdev.sql into your ScriptDev2 database (Named scriptdev2 by default)



REMEMBER THE ACID QUERIES MUST BE INSERTED AFTER YOU HAVE A WORKING MANGOS DB INSTALLED OR AFTER UPDATING YOUR CURRENT DB TO CURRENT VERSION.

IF YOU UPDATE SD2 I HIGHLY RECCOMEND YOU RUN THE ACID MANGOS DB FILE AGAIN TO MAINTAIN ALL SCRIPT LINKS.



Once all queries are inserted check mangos console when starting up for a line similar to "SD2: >> Loaded xxxx EventAI_Events" without quotes, the xxxx is a number that might differ based on if you have custom scripts or not.
