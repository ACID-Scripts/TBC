Acid Release Help file



ACID is the encapsulation of database information for EventAI.

Currently ACID will only contain EventAI scripts but in the future we plan on adding opening events and all text sent to the client into ACID for localization support. 

To find out more look at http://forums.scriptdev2.com/index.php?showtopic=2057



Further EventAI Documentation can be found in either Mangos or Trinity Core Repo's. All Information regarding scripting with EventAI is located in that file (EventAI.txt).

We are now introducing a new ACID Version Formatting. It is very simple to follow and previous releases will not be affected by this version system.



3.X.X = WOTLK (3.x.x Client) ACID Releases

2.X.X = TBC (2.4.3 Client) ACID Releases

1.X.X = WoW (1.12.X Client) ACID Releases





Mangos Installation Instructions :



Acid now consists of ONE file xxx_acid.sql where xxx will be the revision number for Acid. To install Acid you MUST have a *working* installation of Mangos and your favorite DB project. get the latest copy of the acid sql files from full_release/x.x.x/ folder of the svn where the x.x.x represent the revision number, so for revision 0.0.1 you would look in https://sd2-acid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sd2-acid/full_release/0.0.1/. 



* Make sure your copy of mangos has the base mangos SQL and a full DB inserted and working.



AFTER applying your Mangos and SD2 Updates apply the following ACID Packs



* Insert xxx_acid.sql into your Mangos Database (Named Mangos by default)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**THIS STEP NO LONGER REQUIRED FOR 3.X.X INSTALLATIONS - This is now for 1.12.1 and 2.4.3 Installations Only**

AFTER YOU UPDATE YOUR ACID VERSION ALWAYS RE-APPLY THE "mangos_scriptname_full.sql" FROM THE VERSION OF SD2 YOU ARE USING TO PREVENT ANY POSSIBLE OVERLAP PROBLEMS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



REMEMBER THE ACID QUERIES MUST BE INSERTED AFTER YOU HAVE A WORKING MANGOS DB INSTALLED OR AFTER UPDATING YOUR CURRENT DB TO CURRENT VERSION.



Once all queries are inserted check mangos console when starting up for a line similar to "SD2: >> Loaded xxxx EventAI_Events" without quotes, the xxxx is a number that might differ based on if you have custom scripts or not.





Trinity Installation Instructions :



Acid now consists of ONE part xxx_acid.sql where xxx will be the revision number for Acid. To install Acid you MUST have a *working* installation of Trinity and your favorite DB project. Get the latest copy of the ACID sql files from full_release/x.x.x/ folder of the svn where the x.x.x represent the revision number, so for revision 0.0.1 you would look in https://sd2-acid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sd2-acid/full_release/0.0.1/. 



* Make sure your copy of Trinity has the base world SQL and a Full DB inserted and working.



AFTER applying your Trinity Core and TDB Updates apply the following ACID Packs



* Insert xxx_acid.sql into your Trinity Database (Named WORLD by default)
