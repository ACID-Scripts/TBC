To install Acid you MUST have a *working* installation of Mangos and your favorite DB project. get the latest copy of the acid sql files from full_release/x.x.x/ folder of the svn where the x.x.x represent the revision number, so for revision 0.0.1 you would look in https://sd2-acid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sd2-acid/full_release/0.0.1/. 



* Make sure your copy of mangos has the base mangos SQL and a full DB inserted and working.



AFTER applying your Mangos and SD2 Updates apply the following ACID Packs



* Insert xxx_acid.sql into your Mangos Database (Named Mangos by default)



AFTER YOU UPDATE YOUR ACID VERSION ALWAYS RE-APPLY THE "mangos_scriptname_full.sql" FROM THE VERSION OF SD2 YOU ARE USING TO PREVENT ANY POSSIBLE OVERLAP PROBLEMS.



REMEMBER THE ACID QUERIES MUST BE INSERTED AFTER YOU HAVE A WORKING MANGOS DB INSTALLED OR AFTER UPDATING YOUR CURRENT DB TO CURRENT VERSION.



Once all queries are inserted check mangos console when starting up for a line similar to "SD2: >> Loaded xxxx EventAI_Events" without quotes, the xxxx is a number that might differ based on if you have custom scripts or not.
